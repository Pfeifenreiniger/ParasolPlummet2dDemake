__________________________

This is my second ever game project (also my second own project with PyGame).
Therefore, the code is overall pretty messy and not very well optimized, but it was a great opprtunity to enhance my programming knowledge.

Graphics are made with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop (even tho they are heavily "inspired" by Nintendoâ„¢ originals of course).

It took me about one month to complete the project with an active working time of about 35-40 hours in total (code, game-logic, and graphics).

Please consider the docstring of the main.py file for some more information.
